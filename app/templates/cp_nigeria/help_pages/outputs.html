        The output page summarizes all results from the previous steps. All parameters are provided with an information
        icon to display more information about the parameter. Please hover over the icon to display more information about
        each parameter. For information displayed in graph form, hovering over the graph area should display further information.
        All graphs are interactive and allow options like zooming, panning or selecting and de-selecting specific traces by
        clicking on them in the legend.
        The results are divided into four sections:
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        The overview contains all of the basic project information at first glance. The information on the summary table
        is explored in more detail in the following sections.
        <h4>Mini-grid System Information</h4>
        This section contains information about the mini-grid system. This includes the demand and the optimal capacities
        to fulfill the demand at least-cost. This section also displays the costs for the power supply system broken down by asset.
        The stacked timeseries displays how the mini-grid satisfies the demand at any given hour. The graph is set to
        display the first week of operation, but can be toggled within the graph to display the full year.
        <h4>Financial Information</h4>
        The financial information contains the information about the chosen business model. Additionally, the results
        from the comprehensive financial analysis are contained here. This section provides information on
        (i) the system costs, (ii) financial indicators on project performance and (iii) the financing structure.<br>
        <b>Financing Structure</b>:There are multiple sources of financing: Equity from the project developer, equity from the community and an
        acquired grant. A loan is assumed to cover the rest of the costs that canâ€˜t be covered though grants and equity.
        The tariff is directly dependent on the height of the loan, since <b>the loan is repaid through the revenues
        generated by the tariff</b>. The higher the loan is, the higher the tariff needs to be in order to repay the loan. <br>
        <b>Cash Flow Breakdown</b>: The cash flow diagram displays the financial viability of the mini-grid project
        by plotting the revenue (generated by the tariffs) against the expenditures of the project, which include both
        operational expenditures and loan repayments. After the initial loan maturity, the first loan would be repaid. However, there
        are some assets (such as the battery) that may need replacement, so the tool accounts for an additional loan
        to cover these costs, which causes the debt repayments to continue until the end of the project lifetime. <br>
        <b>Investment costs</b>:
        Even though the costs for the power supply system are the highest, there are other investment costs that come
        with building a mini-grid, such as labour, logistics, transmission network, etc. These costs are approximated
        here to calculate the total investment costs. The community does <b>not</b> need to pay the total investment costs
        upfront. <br>
        <b>Operation and Maintenance costs</b>: Apart from O&M on the mini-grid, there are other costs (e.g. land lease
        or security) that need to be covered periodically. Here, the operational expenditures are estimated for the
        first year. These expenditures need to be paid periodically and are likely to increase each year, which is
        accounted for in the displayed cash flow.
