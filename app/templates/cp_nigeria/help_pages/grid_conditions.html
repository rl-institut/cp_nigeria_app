        The process of planning a mini-grid can differ depending on if the community has an existing connection to the
        main grid (regardless of the connection being functional) or not. With an interconnected mini-grid, the DisCo
        is always involved in the mini-grid project. With an isolated mini-grid, you might need to check if your community
        is part of a five-year expansion plan.
