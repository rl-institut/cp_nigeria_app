        The process of planning a mini-grid can differ depending on if the community has an existing connection to the
        main grid (regardless of the connection being functional) or not. In any case, it is highly recommended
        to get in touch with the assigned DisCo of your area. Without permission of the DisCo, it is not allowed to
        commission and build a mini-grid system. <a href="https://nerc.gov.ng/need-help/">Here</a> you can find contact
        information for your respective DisCo.

        <p>
        If your community is assigned to an Independent Electricity Distribution Network Operator (IEDNO), commissioning
        a mini-grid system in your community is prohibited by national regulation.
