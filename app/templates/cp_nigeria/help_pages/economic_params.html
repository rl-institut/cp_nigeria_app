    <h4>Financing sources</h4>
        <p>
        There are multiple sources of financing for a potential mini-grid project: Equity from the project developer,
        equity from the community and an acquired grant. A loan is assumed to cover the rest of the costs that canâ€˜t be
        covered though grants and equity. The total size of the loan will is not given as a user input, but instead
            will be calculated from the remaining costs after subtracting <span class="helpvar">Grant share</span>,
            <span class="helpvar">Mini-grid company equity</span> and <span class="helpvar">Community equity</span> from
            the total investment costs.
        </p>
            <p>
                <i>
                    <b>Note:</b> Please consider that <span class="helpvar">Grant share</span> and <span class="helpvar">Mini-grid company equity</span>
                    are input as percentages of the total investment costs, while <span class="helpvar">Community equity</span> is an absolute number.
                    This is done to allow the user to input a realistic amount of money that could be raised within the community,
                    regardless of the total project costs. Please also consider that percentages should be input as numbers ranging to 100
                    (e.g. 5% instead of 0.05).

        <p>
        To
        consider the loan repayments in the project cash flow, please input the expected <span class="helpvar">Interest rate for the loan</span>, as well as
        the <span class="helpvar">repayment period</span>.
        </p>

    <h4>Additional parameters</h4>
        <p>
        <span class="helpvar">Interest rate for replacement loan:</span> After the given loan maturity years, the initial loan
        would be fully repaid. However, there are some assets that may need replacement, as their lifetime is typically
        shorter than the project lifetime (namely battery storage and diesel generators). To cover these costs,
        the tool considers an additional loan after ten years
        to cover replacement costs. Here, the user has the option to input the assumed interest rate for this additional loan.
            </p>
<!--        TODO why is the energy system exempt from VAT again?-->
        <p><span class="helpvar">Tax factor:</span> The tax factor will be applied to logistics and labour costs. In Nigeria, the main VAT rate is
        <a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/nigeria/corporate/other-taxes">7,5%</a>, which is the default value set in the tool.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span class="helpvar">Fix project costs:</span> The financial considerations in the tool already assume a number of additional costs
        beyond the energy system investment costs, e.g. the tool makes assumptions for labour, security, and land lease costs.
        These costs will be computed along with the energy system simulation and displayed in the results page. If the user
        is aware of additional fix project costs that will occur (e.g. land purchase or some other fix payment), it can be
        input into this field.
