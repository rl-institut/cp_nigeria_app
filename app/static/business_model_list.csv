Hence, the project developer owns generation as well as distribution assets and is responsible for providing (or attracting) capital, engaging customers, taking care of operation and maintenance, and fulfilling all regulatory duties. The community's role is rather small, however, certain roles can be negotiated with the project developer, such as installation and maintenance tasks.",isolated_operator_led.png,isolated_operator_led_resp.png

The co-op together with the undergrid community is responsible for project planning, development, and capital raising. The co-op owns the mini-grid generation and distribution assets and is responsible for customer relations and billing. For certain tasks, the co-op engages a mini-grid operator on behalf of the community and uses the operator's experience by subcontracting the installation of generation, storage, and distribution as well as respective responsibilities related to operation and maintenance. The cooperative-led model strongly enhances local awareness and engagement. While attracting commercial financing is often difficult under a co-op approach, a co-op may have access to concessional financing options and can achieve lower tariffs for customers in the community. Also, entities such as Nigeria's Rural Electrification Agency (REA) or other government agencies can provide support to communities in the early phases of project development.

Under this approach a private mini-grid operator leads development of the mini-grid and consults the distribution company and community as needed. The Mini-grid operator is responsible for providing (or attracting) capital, engaging customers, and taking over operation and maintenance duties of generation assets. The operator company owns the mini-grid generation assets, while the present distribution company owns the distribution assets and collects a usage fee. The community's role is rather small and can be negotiated with the operator company. ",interconnected_operator_led.png,interconnected_operator_led_resp.png

The SPV enables (distribution company) investors to own the generation assets and capture mini-grid profits. The SPV raises capital and takes over the project development roles. While the SPV has limited experience with the mini-grid operation, such as managing customer relationships, as well as meter, bill, and collect from customers, these responsibilities are outsourced and subcontracted to an operator company. Through the DisCos investor expertise, the SPV-led model best addresses financing barriers, such as high commercial interest rates and high-risk profiles of mini-grid projects.",interconnected_spv_led.png,interconnected_spv_led_resp.png

The co-op engages the DisCo and mini-grid operator on behalf of the community and uses the experience of an operator, i.e. subcontracting generation, storage, distribution, and O&M functions. Depending on local technical and financial capacities as well as governance skills, the cooperative-led model overcomes best the lack of local awareness and engagement.

interconnected_collaborative_spv_led,interconnected,"[""Affordable tariff"",""Best model to address financial, technical, and local ownership barriers""]","[""Very low speed of implementation"",""High regulatory complexity"",""Complicated steering structure""]","Under the collaborative SPV-led model, the ownership and operation functions are shared among the mini-grid operator, community cooperative, and DisCo investors. Therefore, a special purpose vehicle (or other legal structure) is created that brings together the three parties. The model aims at sharing ownership across each entity, maximizing buy-in from all project participants while sharing risk and leveraging individual strengths. As the SPV as a whole leads all project roles, the operator, the DisCo investors and the co-op are forced to negotiate and balance interests and responsibilities for the benefit of all. If managed well against the background of a complicated hybrid ownership structure, the collaborative SPV-led model may leverage the strength of each partner in terms of attracting capital, operation and maintenance and customer relations. In this context, financial, technical, and awareness barriers can be addressed equally. ",interconnected_collaborative_spv_led.png,interconnected_collaborative_spv_led_resp.png
